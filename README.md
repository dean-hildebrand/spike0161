# Hi, I'm Dean Hildebrand

As a former chef and now software engineer, I am excited to delve into a new industry that allows for growth and unlimited learning opportunities. I completed Flatiron Coding Bootcamp in March 2020 and have spent my time outside of school learning and sharpening my skills mainly in Javascript, React and React-Native. I love learning new technologies and languages and learning to keep my code clean, dry, and as efficient as possible. 

I am currently looking for a Junior or Entry level role and would love to connect with other like-mind people to talk with and code with as well.
